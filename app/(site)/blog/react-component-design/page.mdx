## use event driven props

### Don't

```tsx
const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(initialState);

<Modal setOpen={setOpen} />
```

Hard to tell when the opening state is changing.

### Do

```tsx
const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(initialState);

<Modal
  onOpen={() => setOpen(true)}
  onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
/>
```

In control of your components state. We have full control over when our open state is changing.

## boolean props should default to false

A common pattern in component design is to have boolean props that either enable or disable some functionality.
This is a pattern I really enjoy.
It makes it easy to not only maintain a component with slight variations in usage, but also eases the use.
It would be painful for a component consumer to need to juggle between two different components for a normal button and a loading button component for instance.

However, a common pit fall when designing components with boolean props is that the default value of the boolean prop is set to true.
As a consumer of a component you don't necessarily have easy access to the default values of its props.
